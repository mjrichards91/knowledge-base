# React Native

## Installation

Follow the [getting started guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) provided by React Native.

`npm 5` is currently not suppported to create and run a project ([source](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14767)). Use `yarn` instead.

```bash
$ brew install yarn
$
$ create-react-native-app AwesomeProject
$
$ yarn start
```

Make sure `watchman` is installed as well to correctly start the project server 

```bash
$ brew install watchman
```

## Plugins

# React Native

## Installation

Follow the [getting started guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) provided by React Native.

`npm 5` is currently not suppported to create and run a project ([source](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/14767)). Use `yarn` instead. `brew install yarn` and then run the command to create a project. 

Make sure `watchman` is installed as well to correctly start the project server (`brew install watchman`).

## Plugins

Note: These plugins are are found by simply searching, I have no experience using any of them.

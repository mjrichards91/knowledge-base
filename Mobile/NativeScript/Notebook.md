The `selector` option on a Component defines the name of the template if it were to be used in other views. A Component selector named `foo-bar` can be used in another component with `<foo-bar></foo-bar>`. The selector value for the initial component can be inferred and does not matter. 

```js 
@Component({
    selector: "foo-bar",
    ...
})
```

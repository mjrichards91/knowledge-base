# Scrum Master Guide

## Daily Scrum

1. Discuss the backlog. Items of consideration for the backlog:
    * Are remaining estimates up-to-date?
    * Are there new ranked stories to discuss?
    * Has the ranking changed for any stories?
    * Is the remaining estimate realistic at that point?
2. Daily Scrum
    * Each member of the team covers 3 main talking points:
     * What did I do since the last daily scrum?
      * What will I do today to further the sprint goals?
      * Are there any impediments in my way?
    * Make sure each member is providing enough information. Vague responses should be questioned.
3. Keep in mindâ€¦
    * The daily scrum should last 15 minutes. Any extended talks that are needed should be held outside of this collaboration
    * This is also a time to let team members know about any time off or external project time that will impede progress on the sprint
    
## Work with Product Owner

1. Keep an open dialog with the PO to help with any issues that they may be facing:
      * Issues with the development team
      * Issues with the backlog
      * Issues with the customer
2. Maintain the backlog with the PO
      * Help allocate reasonable amounts of work for a sprint.
      * Help create collective understanding of backlog items.
3. Schedule any meetings necessary to keep all members in sync (backlog grooming, reviews, etc.)

## Motivation

1. Be a coach to the entire team
2. Provide feedback to help the team grow and become experts to the agile process

## Retrospective

1. Choose a retrospective theme and lead the conversation
2. Assure the team continues to follow committed changes discussed in this collaboration throughout all sprints

## Scrum of Scrums

1. Participate in a "Scrum of Scrums" to discuss projects with all scrum masters
2. This is to be similar to the daily scrum with more focus on the following:
      * Team progress in regards to the agile process
      * Team impediments
      * Team accomplishments
      * Team changes
      
## Planning Poker

Planning poker is the concept of the development team sizing a project through the exercise of assigning points to stories to determine their degree of difficulty. The degree of difficulty can be summarized by these items: complexity, effort, and doubt (risk). Stories are discussed as a team and when the details are hashed out, everyone votes and comes to a consensus as to how many points a story is worth. As scrum master, it is your responsibility to coach the team through this process to understand how it works, facilitate healthy arguments to get everyone's perspective, and to see the process through to the end. Below lists a number of guidelines to make sure the team is adhering to:

1. A consensus must be made. There is to be no averaging of points. When there are differences in scores, they should be discussed to possibly uncover missing details that the team was unaware of. Votes should be casted until the team all agrees on the same point value. If a consensus absolutely cannot be made, take any of these approaches (at the teams discretion): take the highest value (to be conservative), take the lowest value (to be agressive), take the majority value, or simply average (should be last option).
2. Stories that have a high number of points (20+) should be attempted to be broken down if possible during this time. If not possible, it will need to be broken down during the sprint planning. 
3. There should be zero discussion of hours or developer days. All stories are to be sized in terms of points.

## Tasks

There are a variety of tasks a Scrum Master can and should be doing regularly.

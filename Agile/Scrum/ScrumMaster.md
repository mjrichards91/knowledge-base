# Scrum Master Guide

## Daily Scrum

1. Discuss the backlog. Items of consideration for the backlog:
    * Are remaining estimates up-to-date?
    * Are there new ranked stories to discuss?
    * Has the ranking changed for any stories?
    * Is the remaining estimate realistic at that point?
2. Daily Scrum
    * Each member of the team covers 3 main talking points:
     * What did I do since the last daily scrum?
      * What will I do today to further the sprint goals?
      * Are there any impediments in my way?
    * Make sure each member is providing enough information. Vague responses should be questioned.
3. Keep in mindâ€¦
    * The daily scrum should last 15 minutes. Any extended talks that are needed should be held outside of this collaboration.
    * This is also a time to let team members know about any time off or external project time that will impede progress on the sprint.

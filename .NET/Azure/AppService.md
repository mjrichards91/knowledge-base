## Mobile Apps

Mobile Apps can be seen as a regular ol' API with the Azure Mobile Server package included. The Mobile Apps Service includes specific features that allows for:

* Authentication & Authorization
* Offline Syncing
* Push Notifications

There really is no better, comprehensive documentation and examples than [the book provided by Adrian Hall](https://adrianhall.github.io/develop-mobile-apps-with-csharp-and-azure/). Some additional features that Mobile Apps provides that he mentions are:

* Storage of unstructured data (like photos)
* Invocation of custom code?

# Test-Driven Development

## Steps

1. Write a failing test. First write a simple test that asserts the value you want to test. This test will fail, as the method that produces the result does not yet exist.

2. Make the test pass. Implement the method just enough so that the test will pass.

3. Refactor. At this point, the method is probably not complete. Refactor the method to acheive the desired result and the test you have previously written should still be passing. Repeat the steps as you make updates over time.

These steps are often referred to as RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR.
